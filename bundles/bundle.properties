block.touhou-fca-marisa-burner.description = Marisa burner. Basic powerplant. Produces soul power, youkai power, magic power, etc. (electricity) through the 'burning' (power emitting) process of all 'flammable' (items that contain plenty of power) items. 
block.touhou-fba-marisa-battery.name = Marisa battery
block.touhou-fba-marisa-battery.description = Marisa battery. Stores some power and release it when there isn't enough power input. 
block.touhou-fcb-light-generator.name = light generator
block.touhou-fcb-light-generator.description = Generates power from the reaction between Marisa and Rumia element. The building generates power from the difference between the brightness of Marisa element and the darkness of Rumia element. Emits dim light when running. 
block.touhou-fcc-pachuchiru-generator.name = PachuChiru generator
block.touhou-fcc-pachuchiru-generator.description = PachuChiru generator. The building generates power from the difference between the high temperature of the violently 'burning' Patchouli element (Actually not burning, since Patchouli element is not very flammable. Should be something like 'being charged'. ) and the low temperature of Cirno element. Requires Cirno juice as both coolant and extra coldness input. 
block.touhou-dba-reimu-drill.name = Reimu drill
block.touhou-dba-reimu-drill.description = Basic drill. Slowly mines the ore under it. Can mine most types of ore. Uses a little Reimu juice as an optional booster. Does not require power input. 
block.touhou-dbb-marisa-drill.name = Marisa drill
block.touhou-dbb-marisa-drill.description = Basic drill. Quickly mines the ore under it. Can only mine the 'softest' (weakest, except Reimu and Marisa ore) types of ore. If it's boosted with a little Marisa juice, mining speed will be rocketed, which is the best choice for gathering basic elements. Does not require power input. 
block.touhou-daa-p-juice-generator.name = P juice generator
block.touhou-daa-p-juice-generator.description = Generates P juice. It is not essential, but it is always recommended to build a few even if it takes a lot of time to build it. 
block.touhou-dab-1up-juice-generator.name = 1up juice generator
block.touhou-dab-1up-juice-generator.description = Generates 1up juice. Although it is hard to build, it is usually essential. 
block.touhou-dac-b-juice-generator.name = B juice generator
block.touhou-dac-b-juice-generator.description = Generates B juice. It is not essential, but it is always recommended to build a few even if it takes a lot of time to build it. 
block.touhou-dca-reimari-beamdrill.name = ReiMari beamdrill
block.touhou-dca-reimari-beamdrill.description = Basic beamdrill. Slowly mines the ore on the wall. Uses a little Cirno juice as an optional coolant (booster). Requires a little soul power and magic power (electricity). 
block.touhou-dcb-reimarichiru-beamdrill.name = ReiMariChiru beamdrill
block.touhou-dcb-reimarichiru-beamdrill.description = Mines the ore on the wall. Uses a little Cirno juice as an optional coolant (booster). Requires a little soul power and magic power (electricity). With the reflection effect of Cirno element, the maximum tier of the ore this beamdrill can mine, the range and the mining speed of this beamdrill are slightly improved, at the cost of more power consumption. 
block.touhou-dcc-meiling-beamdrill.name = Meiling beamdrill
block.touhou-dcc-meiling-beamdrill.description = Quickly mines the ore on the wall. Uses a little Cirno juice as an optional coolant (booster). Requires a little youkai power (electricity). Cannot mine ore if the building has space with the wall. 
block.touhou-dbc-patchouli-drill.name = Patchouli drill
block.touhou-dbc-patchouli-drill.description = Burst drill. Mines the ore under it. Can mine most types of ore. Requires some Reimu juice to work properly. Requires quite an amount of magic power (electricity). Although it seems inconvenient, it has more health, and it won't get slower when mining 'harder' (stronger) ores. 
block.touhou-dbd-alice-drill.name = Alice drill
block.touhou-dbd-alice-drill.description = Mines the ore under it. Uses a little Marisa juice as an optional booster. Requires some magic power (electricity). Although it is slower than Marisa drill, it can mine more kinds of ore. 
block.touhou-dbe-doll-drill.name = Doll drill
block.touhou-dbe-doll-drill.description = Very small drill (1x1). Slowly mines the ore under it. Slower than Alice drill. Uses a little Marisa juice as an optional booster. Requires some magic power (electricity). Conductive.
